/** Ownership 3 rules
 * 1. Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
 * 2. There can only be one owner at a time.
 * 3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
 */

/**
 * 
 * 1. We can define a "SCOPE" by closure: will see the variable no loger avable out of closure --> Ref1
 * 2. Ownership "MOVE": --> Ref2
 *      - When a variable is default stored in "stake" such as string literal(&str), number and char , rust adapts copy mechanism.
 *      - When a varible is stored in "heap" such as string, vector rust adapts MOVE mechanism. But if we still somehow want to use expensive copy in heap, we can call .clone method
 * 3. Ownership "BORROWING"(Reference) --> Ref3
 *      - Moving ownership makes funtion operation very tedious. So rust introduct "&" ownership "BORROW" a reference --> Ref3.1 & Ref3.2
 * 4. Mutable Reference: --> Ref4
 *      - Reference is immutable in default, we can add &mut to make it mutable reference 
 *      - The rules of mutible reference: 
 *          * only 1 mutible varible for a certian data in a particular scope
 *          * we cannot have mutible mutable reference in one scope
 *          * we cannot mix immutable reference and mutable reference in one scope
 * 5. Slice type: Ref --> Ref5
 *      - To get contiguous sequence of elements wthin a collection (see chapter 8)
 *      - A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.
 *      - Tye type is call &str
 *      - string literal is also a slice type(&str) as string literal is actually a reference of string location of the binary
 * 6. Slice as mentioned is just a reference to a collection, so it can be used for not only string but also vec<T> as &[T] --> Ref6
